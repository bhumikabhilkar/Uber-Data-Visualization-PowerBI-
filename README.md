# Uber-Data-Visualization-PowerBI-


This dataset contains 200,000 records detailing Uber trip information, including trip IDs, fare amounts, pickup and drop-off timestamps, locations (latitude and longitude), and passenger counts. It provides insights into ride costs, trip patterns over time, and spatial data for geographic analysis. With minimal missing values, the dataset is well-suited for visualizations such as time-series trends, fare distribution, and passenger behavior. The spatial coordinates enable mapping of pickup and drop-off hotspots, while the fare_amount and passenger_count fields can uncover insights into trip costs and group dynamics.


After visualizing this dataset in Power BI, key insights can be derived across various dimensions. Geographic maps and heatmaps can highlight pickup and drop-off hotspots, as well as route patterns. Fare analysis will reveal distribution trends, averages by location, and time-based variations. Temporal trends such as peak trip hours and seasonal patterns can be identified, along with how fares vary by time of day. Passenger insights include analyzing the distribution of solo versus group rides and examining the relationship between fares and passenger counts. Additionally, operational metrics like trip durations, distances, and anomaly detection can provide actionable insights for
